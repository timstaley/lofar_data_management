A few quick scripts to ease removal of duplicate files from a multiple user system.

Intended for use with 'findup' from the fslint package:
http://www.pixelbeat.org/fslint/
http://en.flossmanuals.net/FSlint/

'parse_findup_output.py' is a script to organize fslint/findup output and format it into a csv.
The files are scanned to identify who they belong to, 
and then csv files are output to identify duplicates for which both/all copies belong to a single user.
This identifies the easy cases where a single user can decide which copy to retain.

In the case of LOFAR data, the script also scrapes some minimal tags (subband, obs. id) from the folder name.


Usage:
Run findup, e.g. using:
./findup_script.sh /some_big_folder  > big_folder_dupes.txt
or 
./findup_script.sh /some_folder /some_other_folder > multiple_folder_dupes.txt

(You can tweak the search criteria as per the findup --help reference).

Then run:
./parse_findup_output.py folder_dupes.txt

Which will output the summary file 'all_dupes.csv', and also a folder 'user_self_dupes' containing csv's pertaining to single user duplicates.
